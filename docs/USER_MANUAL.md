**Light Intensity Card** üí°
- Measures ambient light levels
- Green: Low light (optimal for most mushroom varieties)
- Yellow: Moderate light (acceptable)
- Red: High light (may inhibit growth)

**CO2 Levels Card** üå¨Ô∏è
- Shows carbon dioxide concentration
- Green: 400-1000 ppm (good air circulation)
- Yellow: 1000-2000 ppm (monitor ventilation)
- Red: Above 2000 ppm (increase ventilation)

**Moisture Card** üí¶
- Indicates substrate moisture levels
- Green: 70-85% (optimal moisture content)
- Yellow: 60-70% or 85-90% (adjust watering)
- Red: Below 60% or above 90% (immediate attention needed)

**Blue Light Card** üîµ
- Specialized light spectrum measurement
- Important for certain mushroom varieties
- Values depend on specific growing requirements

### Reading Timestamps
Each sensor card shows the last update time. Data should refresh every 5 seconds when your ESP32 device is connected.

## üìà Historical Data and Graphs

### Viewing Trends
1. **Tap any sensor card** to view detailed historical data
2. **Select time range** using the time navigator:
   - 1 Hour: Recent short-term trends

- **Device Names**: Give meaningful names to each monitoring location
- **Remove Devices**: Deactivate unused or broken devices

### Application Settings
- **Units**: Choose Celsius/Fahrenheit, metric/imperial
- **Update Frequency**: Adjust how often the app checks for new data
- **Data Storage**: Manage local data retention

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Data Showing:**
1. Check ESP32 device power and WiFi connection
2. Verify device status LED is solid (connected)
3. Restart the app
4. Check internet connection on your mobile device

**Intermittent Data:**
1. Check WiFi signal strength near ESP32 device
2. Verify MQTT broker connectivity
3. Consider moving ESP32 closer to WiFi router

**Inaccurate Readings:**
1. Check sensor connections to ESP32
2. Calibrate sensors if needed
3. Ensure sensors are not blocked or damaged
4. Verify sensor placement in growing environment

### Getting Help
If problems persist:
1. **Check Device Status**: Look for error messages in the app
2. **Restart Everything**: Power cycle both ESP32 and app
3. **Check Network**: Ensure stable internet connection
4. **Contact Support**: Use in-app support or documentation

## üçÑ Mushroom Growing Tips

### Optimal Conditions
Based on your sensor readings, maintain these conditions for most mushroom varieties:

**Temperature**: 18-24¬∞C (64-75¬∞F)
- Consistent temperature is more important than exact values
- Avoid rapid temperature changes

**Humidity**: 80-95%
- High humidity is critical for mushroom development
- Use humidifiers or misting systems as needed

**Air Circulation**: 
- CO2 levels below 1000 ppm indicate good air exchange
- Fresh air exchange 4-6 times per hour

**Light**: 
- Most mushrooms prefer low light conditions
- Some varieties benefit from specific light spectrums

### Using Data for Better Growing
1. **Monitor Patterns**: Look for daily and weekly cycles
2. **Adjust Environment**: Use data to guide climate control
3. **Document Changes**: Note when you make adjustments
4. **Track Results**: Correlate environmental data with harvest success

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- **Clean Sensors**: Gently clean DHT22 and other sensors monthly
- **Check Connections**: Ensure all wires are secure
