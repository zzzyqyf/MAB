# MQTT Performance Improvements

## Changes Made:

### 1. Connection Stability Improvements
- ✅ Increased MQTT keep-alive period from 30s to 60s
- ✅ Added connection timeout of 10 seconds
- ✅ Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for reconnections
- ✅ Added proper disposal checks to prevent zombie connections
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for all MQTT operations

### 2. Reduced Resource Usage
- ✅ Changed periodic status checks from 5s to 30s intervals
- ✅ Reduced connection monitoring from 30s to 60s intervals
- ✅ Added conditional debug logging (only in debug mode)
- ✅ Implemented proper resource cleanup on disposal

### 3. Error Handling Enhancements
- ✅ Added try-catch blocks around all MQTT operations
- ✅ Graceful handling of disconnections and reconnections
- ✅ Proper cleanup on app disposal
- ✅ Status change logging only when status actually changes

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Reduced excessive debug output
- ✅ Optimized timer intervals
- ✅ Added disposal state checks
- ✅ Improved connection state management

## Expected Results:
1. **Reduced App Pausing**: Less frequent connection attempts should reduce UI blocking
2. **Better Battery Life**: Longer intervals between checks
3. **Improved Stability**: Better error handling and resource management
4. **Cleaner Logs**: Only relevant status changes are logged

## Testing:
- Monitor app for reduced "Connection lost, attempting to reconnect..." messages
- Check if app pausing issues are resolved
- Verify MQTT functionality still works correctly
- Observe reduced debug output in release mode
